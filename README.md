# Student Performance Analytics and Trend Analysis | March Madness Reading Challenge
***

## Project Overview ☰

This project analyzes K–5 student reading log data during the March Madness Reading Challenge. It explores trends, participation, outliers, and top performers at the student, class, and teacher levels. The goal is to provide actionable insights for educators and administrators to support instruction, recognize excellence, and monitor student progress.

## Key Takeaways 🔎

       ✓ Identified top-performing students, classes, and teachers to inform recognition and best practices  
       ✓ Highlighted students with zero reading points for targeted interventions  
       ✓ Revealed trends in weekly reading log progression across grades and classes  
       ✓ Detected performance outliers to support data-driven instructional decisions  
       ✓ Provided clear visualizations of participation, engagement, and grade-level contributions 

## Key Features 🔑

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

       ✓ Visualize weekly reading log trends per class (RL1 → RL4)  
       ✓ Identify participation rates across grades  
       ✓ Detect outliers in student performance  
       ✓ Examine grade-level and teacher-level performance differences  
       ✓ Track reading log progression to monitor growth patterns  

* **Derived Insights:**

       ✓ Identify top students, classes, and teachers  
       ✓ Highlight students with zero points for targeted support  
       ✓ Summarize high-performing classes (“Grade Level Winners”)  
       ✓ Spot performance outliers for intervention or recognition  
       ✓ Monitor reading growth trends across weeks  

## Visualizations 📶

       ✓ Line plots of reading log progression trends per grade  
       ✓ Boxplots showing performance distribution and outliers per class  
       ✓ Bar charts of student participation and top-performing classes  
       ✓ Pie charts of top student contributions by grade  
       ✓ Horizontal bar charts for top students per class  
       ✓ Bar charts of zero-point students per grade and teacher  

## Technologies Used 🛠️

       ✓ Python  
       ✓ Pandas  
       ✓ Seaborn  
       ✓ Matplotlib
